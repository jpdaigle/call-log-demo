call-log-demo
=============

code kata exercise

Implement a call log with a parsing step (reads in and parses a file), 
as well as one dummy operation: 
figure out the number of concurrent calls at a specific hour of the day.

There's a simplification here where the log model doesn't have concurrent events, but that's easy to add.
